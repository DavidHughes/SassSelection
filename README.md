SassSelection
=============

SassSelection is a very-much-so-work-in-progress SublimeText 2 plugin which will output the complete CSS selector for a given ruleset/selector fragment in SASS.

Worth pointing out that this is my first (1) Sublime Text 2 plugin and (2) real use of Python, so anyone who happens to see this, feel free to pass tips!

Tests are being executed with the help of the AAAPT lib: https://github.com/guillermooo/AAAPT
